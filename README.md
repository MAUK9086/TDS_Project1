Data Scraping Method
I used the GitHub API to programmatically fetch user profiles and their public repositories. The script authenticated using a Personal Access Token and employed pagination to collect up to 500 repositories per user, storing the results in CSV files for analysis.

Interesting Fact
After analyzing the data, I discovered that a significant percentage of developers had open-source projects with high stargazer counts, indicating community interest and the potential for collaboration.

Actionable Recommendation
Developers should enhance their GitHub profiles by actively contributing to open-source projects, as this can increase their visibility and attract potential collaborators or employers.
